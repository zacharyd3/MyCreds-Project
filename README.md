# MyCreds-Project
A repo to store files and code for the mycreds project at Oshki

Built by Zach Dokuchic | Oshki-Wenjack for use in the MyCreds project.

Before using this script, you will likely want to edit the variables as to where the XML and CSV files are stored.

Steps to using this code:
1. Open the file  "Convert.ps1" with notepad (or any editor of your choice, but notepad is pre-installed).
2. Edit lines 4 & 7 which specify where the CSV and XMl files are located and going to be sent. By default they are stored in "C:\IT\XML Conversion\Source CSV" & "C:\IT\XML Conversion\Destination XML"
3. Once you have moved the folders to where you want them, drop the csv files in the newly specified folder and then run the ps1 file.
